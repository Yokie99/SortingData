////// Notes 
+ Misunderstood directions how it currently works (2/14/2024)
    + populates 10 entries on the page at a a time and the display number you choose is the amount of entires that are able to be iterated through
+ In order to fix this:
    + delete all the page logic and number button logic
    + rewrite next and pervious arrow functions 
    + hide arrows when a certain number is reached so the counter cant get too large
